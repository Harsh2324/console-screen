        <h1>Project on Console</h1>
        <p>It is easy to configure Visual Studio Code to your liking through its various settings.
             Nearly every part of VS Code's editor, user interface, and functional behavior has options you can modify.
            </p>
            <p>A console is the combination of a monitor and keyboar.
             It is a rudimentary interface in which the monitor provides the output and the keyboard is used for input. ... However, "terminal" may also be used to describe the software that runs on a console, such as a command line interface or remote access program.
